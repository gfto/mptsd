mptsd
=====
mptsd receives mpegts streams from multicast (udp/rtp) or http and combines
them into one multiple program stream that is suitable for outputing to DVB-C
modulator. It is tested with Dektec DTE-3114 Quad QAM Modulator and it
is used in production in couple of small DVB-C networks.

Installation
============
mptsd do not depend on any external libraries. There are two source code
dependancies that come with mptsd - libfuncs and libtsfuncs.

Make sure your kernel has CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS enabled. Otherwise sleep
timeout probably won't be able to calibrate itself and mptsd will not work.

Documentation
=============
mptsd is controlled using command line parameters. Run mptsd to see all of
the parameters and explanation what every one of them does. Also there
are 4 configuration files. In the distribution there are example files that
you can change to suit your needs.

  mptsd.conf          - This file configures the network_id in outputed
                        NIT table and also MPEG PSI tables playout timeouts.

  mptsd_nit.conf      - Configures NIT table output.

  mptsd_channels.conf - Configure inputs, SDT provider name and transport_stream_id

  mptsd_epg.conf      - Configures EIT current/next tables. This file is auto
                        reloaded when it is changed. This allows EPG in output
                        to work.

One mptsd instance should be used for each transponder.

Limitations
===========
mptsd do not apply PCR restamping to output. If hardware modulator requires
correct PCR (most cheap modulators do) it probably won't like what mptsd
outputs. mptsd was tested and found to be working ok with Dektec DTE-3114.

Development
===========
The development is tracked using git. The repository is hosted at github
to get it, run the following command:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/mptsd.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
     OR
   git submodule update --recursive --remote  // if you like to checkout HEAD submodules.

Compiling
=========
After cloning the git repository as described in Development section
just run `make`.
